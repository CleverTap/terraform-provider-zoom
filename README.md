This terraform provider allows to perform Create ,Read ,Update, Delete, Import and Deactivate Zoom User(s). 

## Requirements

* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16 <br>
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.13.x <br/>
* [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) Pro/Premium account 
* [Zoom API Documentations](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/users)


## Application Account
***This provider can only be successfully tested on a premium paid zoom account.*** <br><br>

### Setup

1. Create a zoom account with paid subscription (PRO Plan/Business Account). (https://zoom.us/)<br>

### API Authentication
1. Go to [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)<br>
2. Click on `Build App`. For our purpose we need to make a JWT App. <br>
3. Follow this [Create JWT Zoom App](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/build/jwt-app) website to make an app. <br>
4. This app will provide us with the zoom_api_secret, zoom_api_key, and ZOOM_TOKEN which will be needed to configure our provider and make request. <br>


## Building the Provider
1. Clone the repository, add all the dependencies and create a vendor directory that contains all dependencies. For this, run the following commands:
```cd terraform-provider-zoom
go mod init terraform-provider-zoom
go mod tidy
go mod vendor
```


## Managing terraform plugins
1. Run the following command to create a vendor subdirectory which will comprise of  all provider dependencies. <br>
```
%APPDATA%/terraform.d/plugins/${host_name}/${namespace}/${type}/${version}/${target}
``` 
Command: 
```bash
mkdir -p %APPDATA%/terraform.d/plugins/hashicorp.com/edu/zoom/0.2.0/[OS_ARCH]
```
For eg. `mkdir -p %APPDATA%/terraform.d/plugins/hashicorp.com/edu/zoom/0.2.0/windows_amd64`<br>

2. Run `go build -o terraform-provider-zoom.exe`. This will save the binary (`.exe`) file in the main/root directory. <br>
3. Run this command to move this binary file to appropriate location.
 ```
 move terraform-provider-zoom.exe %APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins\hashicorp.com\edu\zoom\0.2.0\[OS_ARCH]
 ``` 
[OR]

1. Manually move the file from current directory to destination directory <br>


## Working with terraform

### Application Credential Integration in terraform

1. Add `terraform` block and `provider` block as shown in [example usage](#example-usage).
2. Get a pair of credentials: zoom_api_secret and zoom_api_secret. For this, visit https://marketplace.zoom.us/.
3. Assign the above credentials to the respective field in the `provider` block.

### Basic Terraform Commands
1. `terraform init` - To initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
2. `terraform plan` - To create an execution plan. Displays the changes to be done.
3. `terraform apply` - To execute the actions proposed in a Terraform plan. Apply the changes.

### Create User
1. Add the user email, first name, last name, status, license_type, deartment, job_title, location in the respective field as shown in [example usage](#example-usage).
2. Run the basic terraform commands.<br>
3. On successful execution, sends an account setup mail to user.<br>

### Update the user
1. Update the data of the user in the `resource` block as show in [example usage](#example-usage) and run the basic terraform commands to update user. 
   User is not allowed to update `email`.
   
2. Update the `status` of User from `active` to `inactive` or viceversa and run the basic terraform commands.

### Read the User Data
Add `data` and `output` blocks as shown in the [example usage](#example-usage) and run the basic terraform commands.

### Delete the user
Delete the `resource` block of the user and run `terraform apply`.

#### Import a User Data
1. Write manually a `resource` configuration block for the user as shown in [example usage](#example-usage). Imported user will be mapped to this block.
2. Run the command `terraform import zoom_user.user1 [EMAIL_ID]` to import user.
3. Run `terraform plan`, if output shows `0 to add, 0 to change and 0 to destroy` user import is successful, otherwise recheck the user data in `resource` block with user data in Zoom website.
